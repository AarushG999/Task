# Chemical Compound Classifier
The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. The Task is to build a classification model on the given dataset using Deep Learning Algorithm and compare its performance to Gradient Boosting Classifier.

Concepts: PCA, Gradient Boost, Neural Networks
