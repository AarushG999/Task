# Chemical Compound Classifier
The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. I have Built a classification model on the given data using any Deep Learning approach and compared its performance with Gradient Boosting Classifier.

Concepts : PCA, Gradient Boost, Neural Networks
